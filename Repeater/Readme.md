# Repeater

For this example you have to create a topology with two hosts connected via one switch (the target of your p4 program). Your objective is to connect both hosts.

The base **p4app.json**, **repeater.p4** and **cli_script** are provided.  

Use:

* **p4app.json** to define your topology;

* **repeater.p4** to define your p4 program;

* **cli_script** to define the commands that are going to be executed in mininet.
